# CONTRIBUTING

This is a hobby project mainly for my kids - features will be added as my kids decide they need them and when I think of something interesting.

If you want to contribute to make this project a little more useful to yourself or others, please create a pull request or an issue. 

When I have time I will take a look at everything.
