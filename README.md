# Game Maker Platformer (Starter project)

## Description

A basic platformer starter project for Game Maker. I'm creating this as a starting point for myself and my kids, I'll get all the basics working for them and then we can all create our own games.

I'm adding many more comments that I would normally, these are to explain what each section of code does so my kids can easily see which parts of the code they may need to modify.

I'm only building the basics of each feature, if you decide to use this starter project you are probably going to need to tweak things here and there.

I've added showDebug variables to some of the object create events, if set to true these will output some useful values from the step event so you can see what is happening.
