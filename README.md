# Game Maker 2 Platformer (Starter project)

## Description

A basic platformer starter project for Game Maker. I'm creating this as a starting point for myself and my kids, I'll get all the basics working for them and then we can all create our own platformers.

I'm adding many more comments than I would to my own projects, these are to explain what each section of the code is doing so my kids can easily see which parts of the code they may need to modify if they want to change a behaviour.

I'm only building the basics of each feature, if you decide to use this starter project you are going to need to tweak things here and there, there are variables to adjust the feel - check out `player/create`

You can see what my eldest is doing on his [profile](https://github.com/jackblackborough) - it will gives you an idea on how to use the Project. You should put your stuff in a `MyGame` or similar group, extend the base objects and inherit the create event.
